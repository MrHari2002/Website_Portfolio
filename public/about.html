<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>About Hengrui Jia</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Hengrui Jia, a passionate and dedicated computer science graduate from Macalester College. With a solid academic foundation and a diverse range of professional experiences, I'm driven to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and make a meaningful impact.</p>

<h3>Education & Academic Achievements</h3>
<p>I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN. During my academic journey, I delved deep into various subjects including Object-Oriented Programming, Software Development, Statistical Modelling, and Parallel Programming, to name a few. My commitment to excellence is reflected in my GPA of 3.84/4.0 and my inclusion in the Deanâ€™s List. I also had the privilege of serving as a Teaching Assistant for Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, where I got the chance to mentor and guide fellow students.</p>

<h3>Skills & Expertise</h3>
<p>My proficiency extends across a spectrum of technologies and languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Flutter (Dart), SQL, C, C++, and more. I'm also well-versed with tools like SPSS, Mathematica, R studio, and Shell Script. Besides technical skills, I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese and English, allowing me to communicate and collaborate in diverse settings.</p>

<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
<p>My journey in the tech industry has been diverse and enriching. From working as a Student Researcher at the University of Wisconsin, where I explored machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques, to my role as a Mobile Software Engineer at Macalester, where I spearheaded the development of an iOS application, I've always been eager to learn and innovate. My internship at Ebest Mobile in Shanghai further solidified my expertise in database management, particularly using SQL with Java.</p>

<h3>Research & Publications</h3>
<p>Research has always intrigued me. My work on parallel programming at Macalester and data analytics for the ASA Macalester College DataFest have been insightful experiences. I've also co-authored a paper titled "Deep Learning Patch-Based Approach for Hyperspectral Image Classification," presented at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology.</p>

<h3>Personal Note</h3>
<p>Beyond the world of codes and algorithms, I believe in the importance of setting clear goals and understanding their deeper implications. Each challenge, be it a programming bug or a complex algorithm, is an opportunity to learn and grow. Through collaboration, perseverance, and a clear vision, I aim to contribute positively to the tech world and beyond.</p>
